- You can get some of the geospatial data from https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/110m-cultural-vectors/

should you decide to use  **Natural Earth** instead. 


- Additional use of Geopandas you can consults https://geopandas.org/en/stable/index.html

- Working with map polygons and other complex file systems can be  challenging for beginners hence one can start wirh GIS or ArcGIS and build on top of that. If havin trouble with `.shp` files you can revert to the defaault geopandas
