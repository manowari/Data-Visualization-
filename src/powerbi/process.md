FYI, some simple process that can act as a roadmap for beginners : 
1. **Import Data**:
   - Open Power BI Desktop.
   - Click on "Get Data" from the Home tab.
   - Choose "Text/CSV" and select the "sample_data_with_marketing.csv" file.
   - Click "Load" to import the data into Power BI.

2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**:
   - Once the data is loaded, you might need to clean and transform it if necessary. This may include renaming columns, changing data types, or handling missing values.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Begin by exploring the data to understand its characteristics.
   - Use visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots to analyze distributions, correlations, and outliers in the data.
   - For example, you can create a histogram to visualize the distribution of customer ages or a scatter plot to explore the relationship between temperature and total spent.

4. **Geospatial Visualization**:
   - Create a map visualization to plot the geographic locations of the data points (cities) based on latitude and longitude.
   - You can color code the data points based on different variables such as temperature, total spent, or campaign engagement to observe spatial patterns.

5. **Time Series Analysis**:
   - Use line charts or area charts to visualize how temperature, purchases, or total spent change over time.
   - You can aggregate the data by hour, day, week, or month to analyze trends and seasonal patterns.

6. **Customer Segmentation**:
   - Utilize demographic and behavioral variables to segment customers.
   - Apply clustering algorithms to group customers based on similarities in demographics, purchase behavior, or engagement with marketing campaigns.
   - Visualize the clusters using scatter plots or parallel coordinate plots to understand the characteristics of each segment.

7. **Campaign Performance Analysis**:
   - Analyze the effectiveness of marketing campaigns by examining campaign engagement metrics.
   - Create visualizations to compare campaign engagement levels across different demographic groups or geographic regions.
   - Identify which campaigns perform best and explore factors that contribute to their success.

8. **Dashboard Creation**:
   - Combine all relevant visualizations into an interactive dashboard.
   - Add slicers, filters, and drill-down capabilities to allow users to explore the data dynamically.
   - Design the dashboard layout for clarity and usability, keeping the end-user in mind.
