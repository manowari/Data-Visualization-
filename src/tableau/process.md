Tableau offers usage of dbs and you can use a local server to test or csvs. I'll utilize a python tool which can be installed via `pip install tableau-api-lib` 



Generally this is the procedure:

1. **Open Tableau Desktop**.
2. **Connect to Data**: Select "Text File" as the data source and import the "marketing_data.csv" file.
3. **Prepare Data (if needed)**: Perform any necessary data cleaning or transformation.
4. **Create Visualizations**: Drag and drop fields onto the Rows and Columns shelves to create charts, graphs, etc.
5. **Customize Visualizations**: Adjust formatting, colors, labels, etc., to improve clarity and aesthetics.
6. **Build Dashboards**: Combine multiple visualizations into dashboards for interactive presentations.
7. **Save Workbook**: Save your Tableau workbook (.twb or .twbx file) for future reference.
8. **Publish (optional)**: If you have Tableau Server or Tableau Online access, you can publish your workbook for sharing and collaboration.
